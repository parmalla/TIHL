#### Pointers From Android Course

Vector Drawables are usable from API 19. Use support libraries to make them usable in lower android versions.
- Enable the use of support library for vector drawables in build.gradle file (app level):
   ```kotlin
   vectorDrawables.useSupportLibrary = true
   ```
